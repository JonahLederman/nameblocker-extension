An extension made by me that automatically blacks out any names in a webpage. Great for when you're working on confidential data.
Issues: 
- Doesn't reload content.js functions properly after moving to a new page or reloading, only if you manually reload the extension
- Doesn't keep track of the last names
- Spoilers are loaded in one-by-one, so it's slow and not instant when the page is loaded
- Can't use most websites due to an issue with the JavaScript not being allowed
